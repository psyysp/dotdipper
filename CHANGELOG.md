# Changelog

All notable changes to dotdipper are documented here.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **CI:** Formatted `src/vcs/mod.rs` so the formatting check passes in GitHub Actions.
- **Release workflow:** The Homebrew tap update job now only runs when `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` is configured, so releases no longer fail just because that secret is missing.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-14

### Changed

- **Git push:** When push is rejected because the remote has commits you don't have (e.g. repo created with a README), `dotdipper push` now automatically fetches, rebases your changes onto `origin/main`, and retries the push. No need to run `dotdipper pull` first in this case.
- **Docs:** README now explains that the git repo used for push/pull lives under `~/.config/dotdipper/compiled/` and that you should use `dotdipper pull` / `dotdipper push` rather than raw `git` from `~/.config`.

## [0.7.1] - (previous release)
