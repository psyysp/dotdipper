## üéØ What is Dotdipper?

Dotdipper is a best-in-class dotfiles manager that helps you synchronize, manage, and deploy your configuration files across multiple machines. Built with safety and determinism as core principles, it provides powerful features like:

- üîê **Secrets Encryption** - Manage sensitive config files with age encryption
- üéØ **Selective Apply** - Review and choose which files to apply
- ü™ù **Hooks System** - Automate workflows with pre/post hooks
- üîÑ **GitHub Sync** - Push/pull dotfiles to/from GitHub
- üì¶ **Package Management** - Bootstrap new machines with system packages
- üîç **Smart Diff** - Git-style diffs before applying changes
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety First** - Backups, confirmations, and HOME boundary enforcement

---

## üåü Key Features

### üîê Secrets Management (Milestone 1)

Securely manage sensitive dotfiles with age encryption:

```bash
# Initialize encryption
dotdipper secrets init

# Encrypt sensitive files
dotdipper secrets encrypt ~/.aws/credentials
# Creates: ~/.aws/credentials.age

# Edit encrypted files seamlessly (decrypt ‚Üí edit ‚Üí re-encrypt)
dotdipper secrets edit ~/.ssh/config.age

# Auto-decrypt during apply (in-memory only, never writes plaintext)
dotdipper apply
```

**Security Features:**

- ‚úÖ Age encryption with public/private key pairs
- ‚úÖ In-memory decryption (never writes plaintext to repo)
- ‚úÖ Seamless edit workflow with automatic re-encryption
- ‚úÖ Restrictive permissions (0600) on key files
- ‚úÖ SOPS compatibility (stub for future implementation)

### üéØ Selective Apply & Diff (Milestone 2)

Review changes and selectively apply configurations:

```bash
# See what would change with git-style diffs
dotdipper diff --detailed

# Interactive selection with TUI
dotdipper apply --interactive

# Apply specific files only
dotdipper apply --only "~/.zshrc,~/.config/nvim"

# Apply entire directory
dotdipper apply --only "~/.config/kitty"
```

**Features:**

- ‚úÖ Pre-apply diffs with colored output
- ‚úÖ Interactive TUI for file selection
- ‚úÖ Path filtering (files or directories)
- ‚úÖ Binary file detection and handling
- ‚úÖ Summary counts and detailed listings

### ü™ù Hooks System

Automate your workflow with custom hooks:

```toml
[hooks]
pre_apply = ["echo 'Backing up current configs...'"]
post_apply = [
    "tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf || true",
    "source ~/.zshrc"
]
pre_snapshot = ["echo 'Creating snapshot...'"]
post_snapshot = ["git add -A && git commit -m 'Auto-snapshot' || true"]
```

**Common Use Cases:**

- Reload configurations after applying
- Auto-commit snapshots to Git
- Validate syntax before applying
- Backup critical files

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

Dotdipper is designed with safety as a core principle:

- **HOME Boundary Enforcement** - Refuses operations outside `$HOME` by default
- **Backup Creation** - Creates `.bak.<timestamp>` backups before overwriting
- **Confirmation Prompts** - Interactive confirmations unless `--force` is used
- **Hash-Based Detection** - BLAKE3 hashing for reliable change detection
- **Deterministic Behavior** - Sorted manifests and idempotent operations

## üìñ Usage

### Core Commands

```bash
# Initialize dotdipper
dotdipper init

# Discover dotfiles on your system
dotdipper discover --write

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.dotdipper/config.toml`. Here's a comprehensive example:

```toml
[general]
# Default mode for file operations
default_mode = "symlink"  # or "copy"

# Create backups before overwriting
backup = true

# Active profile (for multi-profile support)
active_profile = "default"

# Files to track
tracked_files = [
    "~/.zshrc",
    "~/.bashrc",
    "~/.config/nvim",
    "~/.tmux.conf",
    "~/.gitconfig"
]

# Include patterns (glob-style)
include_patterns = [
    "~/.config/**",
    "~/.zshrc",
    "~/.bashrc"
]

# Exclude patterns
exclude_patterns = [
    "~/.ssh/**",
    "~/.gnupg/**",
    "**/*.key",
    "**/node_modules/**"
]

[github]
username = "yourusername"
repo_name = "dotfiles"
private = true

[secrets]
provider = "age"  # or "sops" (future)
key_path = "~/.config/age/keys.txt"

[hooks]
pre_apply = ["echo 'Applying dotfiles...'"]
post_apply = [
    "tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf || true",
    "source ~/.zshrc"
]
pre_snapshot = []
post_snapshot = ["git add -A && git commit -m 'Auto-snapshot' || true"]

# Per-file overrides
[files."~/.config/nvim"]
mode = "copy"  # Copy instead of symlink

[files."~/.ssh/config"]
exclude = true  # Never track this file

[files."~/.gitconfig"]
mode = "copy"  # Allow local modifications
```

---

## üéì Common Workflows

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Make changes to your dotfiles
vim ~/.zshrc

# Create snapshot
dotdipper snapshot -m "Updated zsh aliases"

# Push to GitHub
dotdipper push -m "Update zsh configuration"
```

### Managing Secrets

```bash
# Add new encrypted credential
dotdipper secrets encrypt ~/.aws/credentials

# Move encrypted version to tracked location
mv ~/.aws/credentials.age ~/dotfiles/aws/credentials.age

# Add to config.toml tracked_files
dotdipper config --edit

# Snapshot and push
dotdipper snapshot -m "Add AWS credentials"
dotdipper push

# On another machine
dotdipper pull
dotdipper apply  # Auto-decrypts .age files in-memory
```

### Selective Updates

```bash
# Pull latest changes
dotdipper pull

# Review all changes
dotdipper diff --detailed

# Apply only shell configs
dotdipper apply --only "~/.zshrc,~/.bashrc"

# Or use interactive mode
dotdipper apply --interactive
```

### Multi-Machine Setup

```bash
# Machine-specific overrides in config.toml
[files."~/.gitconfig"]
mode = "copy"  # Allow different user.email per machine

[files."~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml"]
mode = "copy"  # Allow different font sizes per machine
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Age command not found:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install age

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install age

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S age
```

**Permission denied on apply:**

```bash
# Check file ownership
ls -la ~/.dotdipper/compiled/

# Fix with force flag
dotdipper apply --force
```

**Diff fails:**

```bash
# Ensure git is installed
which git

# Use summary mode instead
dotdipper diff  # Without --detailed
```

**Hook execution fails:**

```bash
# Make hooks non-fatal with || true
post_apply = ["tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf || true"]

# Test hook manually
sh -c "your-hook-command"
```

### Getting Help

```bash
# General help
dotdipper --help

# Command-specific help
dotdipper secrets --help
dotdipper apply --help

# Run diagnostics
dotdipper doctor

# View configuration
dotdipper config --show
```

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

1. **Always review diffs before applying:**

   ```bash
   dotdipper pull && dotdipper diff --detailed && dotdipper apply --interactive
   ```

2. **Use hooks to automate workflows:**
   - Reload configurations after applying
   - Auto-commit snapshots
   - Validate syntax before applying

3. **Encrypt sensitive files:**
   - SSH keys
   - AWS/GCP credentials
   - API tokens
   - GPG keys

4. **Use per-file overrides wisely:**
   - Copy (not symlink) configs that need machine-specific changes
   - Exclude truly sensitive files from tracking
   - Symlink stable configs for easy updates

5. **Test on a VM first:**

   ```bash
   # In VM
   dotdipper pull
   dotdipper diff --detailed
   dotdipper apply --interactive
   ```
